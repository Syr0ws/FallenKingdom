# This section allows you to configure all the displays of the plugin.
# Here is a quick tutorial which explains you how to setup them.
#
# First of all, for displays in which a text value is expected, you can refer to a text
# set into your lang files. This allows you to keep plugin internationalization and to
# avoid duplicate displays for each language. To do that create your text in your lang
# file and refer to it using the following format: ${path.to.your.text}.
#
# - Display a message in the chat:
# <section-name>:
#   type: "MESSAGE"
#   # The text of the message.
#   text: "${path.to.the.message.text}"
#
# - Display a title:
# <section-name>:
#   type: "TITLE"
#   # The text of the title.
#   title: "${path.to.the.title.text}"
#   # The text of the subtitle.
#   subtitle: "${path.to.the.subtitle.text}"
#
# - Display an action bar:
# <section-name>:
#   type: "ACTION_BAR"
#   # The text of the action bar.
#   text: "${path.to.the.action-bar.text}"
#   # Time in ticks for title to fade in (optional).
#   fade-in: 10
#   # Time in ticks for title to stay (optional).
#   stay: 70
#   # Time in ticks for title to fade out (optional).
#   fade-out: 20
#
# - Display a sound:
# <section-name>:

#   # Available values: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html
#   sound: "PIANO"
